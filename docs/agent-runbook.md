# Agent & operator runbook

Hard-won operational knowledge for working on a **live** OpenMessage install
(supporting a real user, debugging sends, re-pairing). If you are an automated
agent doing a support task, read this first — most of it cost hours to learn
the hard way.

## Data layout — the #1 gotcha

There are **two separate data directories**, and they are **not the same store**:

| Used by | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **macOS app** (live) | `~/Library/Application Support/OpenMessage/` | The real `messages.db` + `session.json`. `BackendManager` launches the backend with `OPENMESSAGES_DATA_DIR` set to this. |
| **CLI default** | `~/.local/share/openmessage/` | What `openmessage read/status/pair/serve` use when run with **no** env var. Frequently **stale** relative to the app. |

Consequences:

- To read or modify the **app's live data** from the CLI, set
  `OPENMESSAGES_DATA_DIR="$HOME/Library/Application Support/OpenMessage"`.
  Querying `~/.local/share/openmessage/messages.db` shows a different
  (usually older) message history — do not trust it for "what did the user
  just receive/send."
- `BackendManager.migrateOldDataIfNeeded()` copies `session.json` (+ db files)
  from `~/.local/share/openmessage` → App Support **only when App Support has
  no `session.json`**. So to force the app unpaired you must clear the session
  in **both** dirs (see re-pairing below), or the migration restores it.

## Reading the user's live messages

The running app holds `messages.db` open in WAL mode, so a second SQLite reader
often fails with `unable to open database file (14)`, and `?immutable=1` opens
but misses WAL-only (recent) writes. **Prefer the running app's HTTP API**
(loopback-guarded; `curl` from localhost passes the origin check):

```
GET /api/status
GET /api/conversations?limit=500
GET /api/conversations/<conversation_id>/messages?limit=N
GET /api/search?q=<term>            # conversation summaries (one row per thread)
GET /api/search/messages?q=<term>   # raw message rows (MessageID/Body/TimestampMS…)
```

**`/api/search` returns conversation-level results** (`ConversationID`, `Name`,
`Participants`, `preview`) for the web UI's search box — parsing message fields
out of it silently yields nothing. For message hits use `/api/search/messages`,
which returns the same DTO as `/api/conversations/<id>/messages` and accepts
`phone`, `conversation_id`, `since`/`until` (YYYY-MM-DD, local; `until`
inclusive to end of day), and `limit` (default 50, max 500).

Outgoing message rows carry a `Status`: `OUTGOING_SENDING` → `OUTGOING_SENT`/
`OUTGOING_DELIVERED`, or `OUTGOING_FAILED:<STATUS>` when a send is rejected.

### Message JSON field names — the epoch-0 trap

The legacy message DTO marshals **Go field names**, not snake_case, for its core
fields, and snake_case only where a tag says so:

```
MessageID  ConversationID  SenderName  SenderNumber  Body  TimestampMS
Status  IsFromMe  MediaID  MimeType  Reactions  ReplyToID
source_platform  source_id  mentions_me  transcript
```

**`TimestampMS` — capital M, capital S, no underscore.** A reader that looks for
`timestamp_ms` or `TimestampMs` silently gets `0`, and formatting epoch 0
renders every message as **1969-12-31 19:00 ET ("Wed 19:00")**. That is not a
data bug and not a Signal bug: an entire thread showing one identical
placeholder timestamp means the reader used the wrong key. Check the raw JSON
before chasing the bridge:

```bash
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:7007/api/conversations/<id>/messages?limit=1" | jq '.[0]|keys'
```

The web UI reads `TimestampMS` throughout, so these names are a stable contract
— don't "fix" them by renaming.

## v2 cutover: conversation IDs re-key (issue #155)

On a **v2-primary** install the API serves the v2 store, where a conversation's
primary key is a derived 32-hex hash (`v2keys.DeriveID("conversation", account,
remoteID)`) — **not** the legacy id. The legacy form is preserved as
`conversations.remote_conversation_id` (`signal:+1555…`, `signal-group:<b64>=`,
a WhatsApp JID, a Google thread id).

Consequence, and the shape of the 7/26 incident: an agent stores
`signal:+1555…` on Friday while the app reads legacy-primary, the app restarts
into v2-primary over the weekend, and every read of that stored id returns `[]`
— the thread looks deleted while its rows sit safely under the hash key. The
fix (this PR) makes v2 reads accept **either** key: unknown ids fall back to a
`remote_conversation_id` lookup across accounts, and the returned DTO always
carries the canonical v2 id. Prefer storing the **v2 id** for anything durable;
the alias exists so old references keep working.

Two more cutover artifacts worth knowing:

- **Only the Google decoder emits `ConversationEvent` frames.** Signal and
  WhatsApp conversations are minted from message frames, which carry no kind and
  no roster. Before this PR that meant post-cutover Signal/WhatsApp **groups
  were stored as `direct`**, and 1:1 threads had **no participants and no
  title** — they listed as blank rows with `Participants: "[]"`. The projector
  now infers kind from the remote ID (authoritative for Signal/WhatsApp,
  never guessed for opaque Google thread ids) and links the direct peer; a
  daemon-startup sweep repairs rows that predate the fix.
- **`/api/status` freshness only measures the ACTIVE read source.** Running
  v2-primary, a stalled v2 ingest projection is invisible there — the legacy
  path can keep ingesting for days while readers see nothing new, and every
  per-platform row still reports `behind_days: 0`. This is not hypothetical: the
  Signal projection stalled from Thu 7/23 to Sat 7/25 while legacy kept writing.
  Each platform entry now also carries `legacy_latest_ms`, `projection_lag_ms`,
  and `projection_stalled` (plus a top-level `projection_stalled`), so read
  those before trusting freshness on a migrated install:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7007/api/status | jq '.freshness'
```

## Google thread ids are device-local: phone swaps re-key everything

Google Messages conversation and message ids are the phone's own row ids, not
account-level identifiers. A new phone, factory reset, or backup restore starts
a fresh id space: the same person's thread arrives under a new numeric id, and
that id can equal the id an unrelated thread had on the old phone. The
signature of a restore is message ids that *increase as the message gets
older* (history was inserted newest-first) with live messages continuing the
counter from wherever the restore stopped.

What that did on 2026-09-03 (phone replaced ~Aug 19; re-pair connected the new
device at 16:03): every new-space frame whose id collided with an old-space
row was appended into that unrelated thread (a campaign text from a new number
landed in a named contact's thread; shortcode promos landed in "Alex Barnett"),
re-served history duplicated because the remote message id changed too, and
once ConversationEvents arrived they overwrote the colliding row's title and
roster ("United Airlines" became "Miro"). The legacy `messages.db` took the
same writes through its own path.

The projector now treats participant identity as the authority for Google
frames: an inbound message whose sender is not the bound direct thread's peer
moves the id to the sender's thread (minting one if needed); a
ConversationEvent whose roster contradicts the bound row re-binds by roster;
re-delivered content (same direction, sender, millisecond, body) is skipped.
Displaced rows keep their history under `displaced:<id>:<conversation_id>` and
are re-linked by peer when their thread shows up under its new id. Watch
`v2_ingest.per_account.<account>.remote_rebinds` and `content_dupes_skipped`
in `/api/status` — a burst right after a re-pair is the fix working, not a
fault.

**Repairing history after a reset** (daemon must be down — the command takes
the instance lock and refuses while `/api/status` answers; park the watchdog
first):

```bash
OPENMESSAGES_DATA_DIR="$HOME/Library/Application Support/OpenMessage" \
  openmessage repair google-idspace --since <RFC3339 or unix-ms of the re-pair> \
  --reference /path/to/pre-incident/store.sqlite3 --report repair.json          # dry run
# review, then add --apply (copies v2/store.sqlite3* to v2/repair-backups/<stamp>/ first)
```

`--since` is the row *creation* time from which rows are suspect. `--reference`
is any copy of `v2/store.sqlite3` taken before the reset (the app-support dir
snapshots agents take before support work are exactly this); without it the
repair still re-files messages but cannot restore overwritten titles/rosters.
Outgoing-only windows are reported as `ambiguous` and left in place: a
message frame carries no recipient, so nothing proves where an outbound text
belongs until the thread's ConversationEvent re-binds the id.

## MCP serving — exactly one process may own live transports

**The failure mode (empirically confirmed 2026-07-20):** `openmessage serve
--mcp-stdio` used to start the **full transport stack** — the Google,
WhatsApp, and Signal supervisors auto-started in every serve mode. MCP hosts
(Claude Code via `~/.mcp.json`, Claude Desktop) spawn one such process **per
session**, each connecting with the **same WhatsApp device credentials and
signal-cli account as the running app**. WhatsApp treats that as a second
device login and kills the session — a fresh pairing at 20:40:41 was dead with
`401: logged out from another device` by 20:41:07, seconds after two Claude
MCP processes spawned. Concurrent signal-cli pollers likewise corrupt/deauth
Signal (the 2026-07-13 WhatsApp logout and Signal's `needs_reauth` death were
this same fratricide). `instance.lock` never protected against this — only
`backup` and `migrate` honor it.

**The fix: MCP client mode.** `serve --mcp-stdio` with no other transport
(the exact shape MCP hosts spawn) is now a **transportless client** of the
running app:

- **Zero transport supervisors, zero dispatchers, zero sync loops, zero
  schedulers, zero telemetry.** The app daemon owns all of those. Regression
  tests: `TestRunServeMCPStdioStartsZeroTransportSupervisors` (cmd) and
  `TestBuiltBinaryMCPStdioClientShapeStartsNoTransports` (binary-level).
- **Reads stay local** (store attach, WAL-safe). At startup the client probes
  the daemon (`/api/status`); if the daemon serves the same data dir and
  reports v2-primary, the client reads the v2 store. With the daemon down it
  falls back to `OPENMESSAGES_V2_*` env exactly like `openmessage read`.
  If `OPENMESSAGES_DATA_DIR` is unset, the client adopts the data dir the
  daemon reports — set it explicitly in the MCP config anyway (see below).
- **The store opens repair-free** (`app.NewClient`): the startup repair
  sweeps (legacy artifacts, contentless recency, tapbacks, empty stubs,
  WhatsApp media placeholders) run only in store-owning entrypoints
  (`app.New` — the daemon and write-capable CLI commands). One client spawns
  per Claude session, so dozens of concurrent sessions must not each burst
  repair writes into the live `messages.db`. The read-only CLI
  (`read`/`status`) opens the legacy store the same way. Regression tests:
  `TestNewClientPerformsNoStoreWrites` (internal/app),
  `TestRunServeMCPClientDoesNotRepairStore` and
  `TestOpenCommandReadSourceLegacyDoesNotRepairStore` (cmd).
- **Sends/reactions route through the daemon** (`/api/v1/outbox` on v2,
  `/api/send`+`/api/react` on legacy), like the CLI has done since PR #140,
  with the same do-not-resend idempotency contract. With the app closed,
  send tools return an actionable "start the OpenMessage app" error — they
  never fall back to opening their own connections.
- Escape hatches: `--transports` forces the old standalone full-stack stdio
  behavior (only for machines where the MCP process is the *only* OpenMessage
  process, ever); `--no-transports` strips transports from a **legacy-mode**
  web/SSE shape (degraded debug instance: local reads work, sends fail with
  "not connected"). On a **v2-primary** install a `--web --no-transports`
  process refuses to start — the v2 read path there needs the dispatcher
  stack — so use the MCP client shape or `openmessage read` for store access
  instead.

**MCP config (`~/.mcp.json`) for a macOS app install:**

```json
"openmessage": {
  "command": "/usr/local/bin/openmessage",
  "args": ["serve", "--mcp-stdio"],
  "env": {
    "OPENMESSAGES_DATA_DIR": "/Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/OpenMessage",
    "OPENMESSAGES_V2_PRIMARY": "1"
  }
}
```

Pin `OPENMESSAGES_DATA_DIR` to the app's dir so reads, the control token, and
daemon-truth detection all line up (two-data-dirs trap above). On a migrated
(v2-primary) install, also set `OPENMESSAGES_V2_PRIMARY=1` — the legacy
`messages.db` froze at cutover, and this keeps MCP reads on the v2 store even
when the app is closed or predates the `auth.data_dir` status field (drop the
line on a non-migrated install). Keep the PATH binary in lockstep with the
installed app — both open the same SQLite stores and a version-skewed binary
can migrate the schema under the older one.

**Never** configure MCP to run `serve --web`, `serve --mcp-sse`, or
`serve ... --transports` alongside the app: those are daemon shapes and will
fight the app for the WhatsApp/Signal sessions exactly as described above.

## Pairing & the "zombie session"

**Symptom:** sends fail with `OUTGOING_FAILED:UNKNOWN`; `/api/status` shows
`google.connected=true`; reconnect and app restarts don't help. The Google
Messages **linked-device session has lapsed** — the phone silently unlinked the
device (common after travel / network changes). The connection flag lies; the
session is dead for sends.

Key facts:

- The native macOS **Platforms** view (`OpenMessageApp.swift`) only offers a
  re-pair control when the session is **absent** (`!google.paired` →
  `ContentView` shows `PairingView`). While it believes it's connected it shows
  "Open inbox / Sync history" with **no re-pair button**. That "Open inbox"
  string is **native Swift, not a stale webview cache** — don't go chasing
  WKWebView caches (a red herring that cost real time). As of PR #42 the **web
  UI** surfaces a "Google Messages isn't sending — Re-pair" banner when
  `google.needs_repair` is set (3 consecutive Google send failures while
  connected). Issue #43 tracks adding the same affordance to the native view.
- **QR pairing is dead** — Google disabled device-pairing QR for many accounts.
  Use **Google Account pairing**.

### Re-pair recipe (the one that works)

1. `osascript -e 'quit app "OpenMessage"'`.
2. Force the native pairing screen by removing `session.json` from **both**
   data dirs (back them up first):
   `~/Library/Application Support/OpenMessage/session.json` **and**
   `~/.local/share/openmessage/session.json` (else migration copies the old one
   back). Other platforms' sessions (`whatsapp-session.db`, `signal-cli/`) are
   independent — leave them.
3. **Clear the stale session FIRST (don't skip).** Running `pair --google` while a dead `session.json` is still in the data dir floods the pairing with `failed to decrypt data event: HMAC mismatch` and yields a new session that 401s on token refresh **immediately** (dead on arrival). Removing both `session.json` files (step 2) before pairing is what produces a healthy session that connects *and* syncs (`/api/status` freshness `behind_days` drops to 0). Some HMAC-mismatch lines are normal noise (events from the phone's own session the pairing client can't read) — the tell for a bad pair is an immediate post-pair 401, not the noise itself.
4. The embedded Google sign-in inside `PairingView` is **blocked by Google**
   ("sign-in not allowed in this app") and dead-ends in Google's troubleshooter.
   Use the **cookie method** instead — extract Google cookies from the user's
   signed-in Chrome and run:
   ```
   OPENMESSAGES_DATA_DIR="$HOME/Library/Application Support/OpenMessage" \
     openmessage pair --google-file <cookiefile>
   ```
   Decrypting Chrome cookies on macOS:
   - key: `security find-generic-password -w -s "Chrome Safe Storage"`
   - derive: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1(key, salt=`saltysalt`, iterations=1003, len=16)
   - decrypt each `encrypted_value`: strip `v10` prefix, AES-128-CBC, IV = 16
     spaces, strip PKCS7 padding; recent Chrome prepends a 32-byte domain hash —
     try stripping the first 32 bytes if the result isn't clean UTF-8.
   - source: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Cookies`
     (the signed-in profile; `Local State` maps profiles → accounts). Build a
     `name=value; name=value; …` header from `.google.com` / `messages.google.com`
     cookies and write it to a `0600` file.
   - **Extract cookies immediately before pairing** — pairing with an older
     extract has returned HTTP 401 (the staleness threshold is not
     established; don't rely on any grace window).
4. `pair --google` prints `EMOJI: <emoji>`. The user taps that emoji in Google
   Messages **on the phone** (notification shade, or profile → Device pairing)
   to confirm. The Gaia client init can time out once — just retry.
6. On confirmation the session saves to the app dir; relaunch the app and sends
   work. Wipe the cookie file afterwards.

### Self-healing (as of #74; requirements fixed 2026-07-20) — try this before any manual cookie surgery

The macOS app **refreshes expired Google cookies in-process** and reconnects
on its own. When the reconnect watchdog sees an expired session
(`auth token: HTTP 401` / `SESSION_COOKIE_INVALID`) it reads the user's
signed-in Chrome cookies, rewrites `auth_data.cookies` in `session.json`, and
reconnects — no re-pair, no script. Implemented in `internal/googlecookies`
(darwin-only; keychain → PBKDF2 → AES-128-CBC, handles the Chrome 130+
`SHA256(host)` prefix, snapshots the cookie DB + WAL for freshness).
`refreshGoogleSessionCookies` prefers an explicit
`OPENMESSAGE_COOKIE_REFRESH_SCRIPT` if set, else this native path;
`canRefreshGoogleCookies()` gates whether the watchdog refreshes or parks.

**Cookie requirements (the 2026-07-20 fix):** a Google-account libgm session
authenticates with the five `.google.com` account cookies
(SID/HSID/SSID/APISID/SAPISID) + SAPISIDHASH — proven live against both
`/web/config` and the RegisterRefresh RPC. A `messages.google.com:OSID`
service cookie exists **only** if the user has opened Messages-for-web in that
Chrome profile; it is preferred when present but **never required**. (Before
the fix, refresh hard-required it, so on profiles that never visited
messages.google.com every repair failed with `missing required cookies:
messages.google.com:OSID` and the app looped in `needs_repair` forever — a
re-pair bought minutes, then died again.)

**Expected steady-state — check WHICH BINARY first.** Before diagnosing any
latched `needs_repair`, confirm the running backend is the fixed build:

```bash
RUNBIN=$(ps -o command= -p "$(lsof -nP -iTCP:7007 -sTCP:LISTEN -t | head -1)" | awk '{print $1}')
echo "$RUNBIN"; strings "$RUNBIN" | grep -c 'persisted rotated Google cookies'   # 0 = pre-fix build
```

**This is the single highest-yield check** — it has explained both stale-build
outages so far (2026-07-22, ~11 min latched; 2026-07-25, 06:54→13:21 local,
~6h26m). Many `.app` bundles on
a dev machine share `CFBundleIdentifier com.openmessage.app` (stale worktree
builds, dated backups, the R8 rollback copy), so LaunchServices can resolve
Spotlight/Dock/`open -a OpenMessage`/notification clicks to a **pre-fix**
build, which then latches `needs_repair` exactly like the original bug. Verify
the resolution and always launch by explicit path:

```bash
osascript -e 'tell application "Finder" to get POSIX path of (application file id "com.openmessage.app" as alias)'
open /Applications/OpenMessage.app
```

Stale-listener hazard (observed 2026-07-25): after quitting the GUI and
launching `/Applications/OpenMessage.app`, port 7007 was **still served by the
old bundle's backend**. (`BackendManager` has adopt/stop logic for existing
backends — `BackendManager.swift` "Reusing existing backend pid" / "Stopping
conflicting backend pid" — but with two same-ID bundles the outcome was a stale
listener.) After any relaunch, verify the listener is the binary you intended
and that the old PID exited:

```bash
ps -o pid=,command= -p "$(lsof -nP -iTCP:7007 -sTCP:LISTEN -t | head -1)"
```

**Observed lifetimes vary by regime; there is no known fixed timer.** An
out-of-band probe replaying a *copy* of the session (2026-07-20, n=1) got
`SESSION_COOKIE_INVALID` after ~14 minutes with Chrome active; fresh-pair
sessions died in ~3-4 min (observed 4×, one account, 2026-07-19). On fixed
builds, observed `auth_expired` episodes were 7/21 08:58, 7/22 16:12, 7/23
09:56, and 7/28 21:58 — roughly 0-2/day on this one account — **each
self-healing in ≤~2.5 min** (three cleared within a 60s sample). The two long
latches (7/22 11:21, ~11 min; 7/25 06:54→13:21, ~6h26m) both occurred while
**pre-fix builds** were running and ended when a fixed binary was
deployed/launched. Why lifetimes differ is **not established** — do not treat
any interval as a law. Healthy looks like: mostly connected, with rare
`auth_expired` dips that self-heal in ~1-2.5 min via Chrome cookie import.
Minutes-scale heal churn is **not** normal — check `google.repairs_paced`
(below).
Rotated cookies are also persisted to `session.json` (throttled, ~5 min) so a
restart resumes from fresh values instead of pair-time snapshots. That write is
atomic (temp file + fsync + rename), so a crash mid-save can never truncate the
paired credentials; a failed save retries at a tenth of the interval instead of
waiting a full one.

**The repair pacing counter.** Automatic repairs are paced to at least
`OPENMESSAGE_REPAIR_MIN_INTERVAL` (default 90s). Every delayed repair logs
`Delaying Google credential repair` (with `wait` and `paced_total`) and bumps
`google.repairs_paced` in `/api/status`:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7007/api/status | jq '.google.repairs_paced'
```

The counter records exactly one thing: **how many repair requests were delayed
by the floor**. A climbing count proves requests arrived faster than the
configured interval — it does not identify why (could be fast revocation, a
crash/reconnect loop, or repeated manual reconnects). It cannot clear the
session healthy either: a single failed repair parks the supervisor in Blocked
with the counter still at 0. For context, observed expiries on fixed builds
were ~0-2/day (one account).

To see *why* a repair failed: the refresh error is currently **returned but
never logged** — the native path emits no log line, and the supervisor
discards the error detail (`handleRepairResult` sets Blocked without logging
it) — so the only way to observe it today is to reproduce it directly: run
`scripts/refresh-google-session-cookies-macos.py` manually and read its error
output. (A fix to log the repair failure is chipped.)

An `auth_expired` session with its device link intact revives by cookie
rewrite alone — **do not re-pair** for `needs_repair`; that resets nothing the
refresh can't fix and risks pairing throttles. So the **first** thing to try
when SMS is dead is nothing — wait ~2-3 min for the watchdog (the one observed
live heal took 2m20s; under-waiting funnels you into the re-pair this section
warns against). If it hasn't recovered, **read the actual repair and reconnect
errors before deciding to re-pair** — the causes are broader than "the cookies
are gone": Chrome/keychain/profile access, missing or undecryptable cookies, a
session-file write failure, network or server rejection, or a genuinely revoked
device link. Re-check the running binary (above) and whether Chrome still holds
the five `.google.com` account cookies first; only once those are ruled out
fall back to the manual re-pair recipe above. The app also posts a **health notification**
(once, on the rising edge) when Google flips to `needs_repair` or WhatsApp
logs out, so a dead platform can't sit silent for days.

Prereq: the app must be **non-sandboxed** (it is — `OpenMessage.entitlements`
is hardened-runtime only) so the backend can read Chrome's cookie DB and the
`Chrome Safe Storage` keychain item. First keychain read may prompt once;
Always Allow persists it.

### Google Messages upstream dependency

**Root cause of the repeated deaths (fixed in #73):** the previous library
dependency was frozen at its 2026-03-02 base and missed upstream's 2026-05-05
[`libgm/longpoll: retry on network error when refreshing auth token`](https://github.com/mautrix/gmessages/commit/0b54a8fe65207f81d353ffe63f4d2549c2eb7976).
Without it, a single transient network blip during a scheduled token refresh
permanently killed the session.

The application now requires `go.mau.fi/mautrix-gmessages` directly, without a
module replacement. The recorded upstream baseline is
[`b0d61b4e1a4e`](https://github.com/mautrix/gmessages/commit/b0d61b4e1a4e94f0d5e6fedd43cadb80bd0a9e51).

**Integration is pending upstream library changes.** This baseline resolves
publicly but does not yet expose `ListConversationsWithCursor` or the public
cancelable `NotifyDittoActivity` used by the application. Compilation is
expected to fail until those APIs are accepted upstream and the requirement is
advanced. The upstream acknowledgement-worker lifecycle fix must also be
included before deployment: disconnect must cancel and join pending ack work
while retaining retries for active clients. Do not remove pagination, weaken
cancellation, or restore a module replacement to bypass this integration gate.

These APIs expose existing Google Messages capabilities to library consumers;
they do not introduce new Google features or change authentication. Cursor
listing retrieves subsequent conversation pages, and the liveness method checks
that the phone can respond. The API proposal overlaps the older
[cursor-listing contribution](https://github.com/mautrix/gmessages/pull/64).

The update requires Go 1.26 and context-aware calls. The accompanying Whatsmeow
update keeps database upgrade registration compatible with the shared util module.

The `gmessages-upstream.yml` workflow checks that the requirement and recorded
version agree, the commit is on canonical upstream, and the auth-refresh retry
fix is included. It also reports new upstream commits for review. The module
contract rejects all replacements for this dependency. Update the requirement,
checksums, workflow revision and documentation together after the prerequisite
changes are merged. Validate with `GOWORK=off`, a fresh module cache, and the
public Go module proxy and checksum database, then run the full normal/race
suites and startup/history-sync checks. Module resolution alone is not proof
that the application compiles or that its runtime regressions are fixed.
The durable architectural fix (move SMS/RCS onto
an Android companion) is issue #75.

### Don't over-reconnect

Connecting/disconnecting the Google web session many times in a short window
(repeated restarts, `reconnect` calls, multiple `pair` runs) gets the account
**throttled** — the long-poll drops and `/api/status` shows
`"Google Messages connection lost; reconnecting…"` in a loop with a perfectly
valid session. The fix is to **stop and let it cool down** (minutes up to ~1h),
not to hammer reconnect. Sends may land in brief connected windows meanwhile.

## WhatsApp linking (QR and phone-number code)

Hard-won facts from the 2026-07-03/04 re-pair ordeal:

- **Passkey-protected accounts can't use phone-number code linking.** If the
  account has a WhatsApp passkey, the server accepts the typed code
  (`companion_finish` returns ok) and then sends `passkey_prologue_request` —
  a WebAuthn challenge only the user's real authenticator can answer. The
  phone shows "Couldn't link device"; the desktop used to idle silently
  (whatsmeow logged "Unhandled notification"). The bridge now surfaces a
  clear "account is protected by a passkey — scan the QR code instead" error
  via `events.PairPasskeyRequest`. QR linking does **not** involve the
  passkey step (the camera scan is the verification).
- **Code + QR windows are short.** Pairing codes expire in ~2 minutes;
  QR refs rotate ~20–60s within a ~3-minute session that ends silently
  (`qr_event: "timeout"`). Generate the code / show the QR only when the
  user's phone is already on the entry/scanner screen.
- **"Couldn't link device. Try again later." on every QR scan = WhatsApp
  refusing, not our bug.** Two causes: (a) zombie companion entries from
  failed attempts eating the 4-device limit — have the user clear stale
  entries in WhatsApp → Linked Devices; (b) a temporary linking throttle
  after repeated failed attempts — stop retrying for a few hours (hammering
  extends it). If a single clean attempt after cleanup + cooldown still
  fails, remove the WhatsApp passkey (Settings → Account → Passkeys), link,
  re-add it.
- **Debugging:** whatsmeow logs used to be discarded (`waLog.Noop`); they now
  flow through the bridge logger (`component=whatsmeow`). Debug-level os_log
  lines are NOT persisted — capture live with
  `log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.openmessage.app"' --level debug`
  **before** the attempt; `log show` after the fact only has warn/error.
- **`go.work` gotcha:** the repo root had an untracked `go.work` whose
  `use ../tmp/whatsmeow` silently overrode go.mod's whatsmeow pin for every
  workspace-mode build (including `macos/build.sh`). If a dependency bump
  mysteriously doesn't take, check `go.work`.

## signal-cli

Require **signal-cli ≥ 0.14.5**. 0.14.1 throws
`NullPointerException: …getSender() … content is null` on certain inbound
envelopes, exits non-zero, never ACKs, and re-hits the same poison message every
poll — a crash loop that flaps the Signal `connected` flag every few seconds and
makes the whole UI flicker. `brew upgrade signal-cli` fixes it. (PR #41 also
hardened the UI to ignore redundant status pushes.)

### Signal `needs_reauth` — read the fingerprint before believing the park

`needs_reauth: true` is the bridge's **interpretation** of a signal-cli error,
not server truth. Three live episodes (2026-07-20, 2026-07-24, 2026-08-06)
parked a **valid** link for 12–22h because one boot-time `listAccounts` came up
empty (signal-cli racing its own account bootstrap logs
`Ignoring <number>: User is not registered.` and exits 0) and the bridge
latched a permanent park; a single `POST /api/signal/connect` reconnected in
~5s each time. The bridge now classifies with corroboration instead:

- The receive-start probe **retries in-generation** (3 attempts, paced),
  then checks `data/accounts.json`. Probe empty but accounts.json still lists
  the account → **transient** exit (`signal_account_probe_empty`), retried on
  supervisor backoff — no park, no `needs_reauth`.
- Only 3 **consecutive generations** of that disagreement park, under
  `signal_account_unreadable` — and that park **self-retests every 15 min**
  (one local `RetryBlocked`; log line "Signal reauth park retest"), so a
  lingering false park heals without manual intervention.
- Server-backed evidence still parks fast and stays parked:
  a receive-loop "not registered" / "authorization failed" needs 2
  consecutive confirmations (seconds), then parks under
  `signal_account_invalid` with **no** automatic retest. Probe empty with
  accounts.json **also** empty parks immediately (`signal_account_invalid`).

Debugging a parked Signal: check `/api/status` and the supervisor fingerprint
before recommending a re-pair. `signal_account_unreadable` → local read
problem, wait for the retest or `POST /api/signal/connect`; verify contention
first (`pgrep -fl signal-cli`, `lsof` on the config dir — see the MCP
fratricide section above). `signal_account_invalid` from `receive` → genuine
server-side unlink, re-pair is real. **Never unpair to "fix" a park**: unpair
`os.RemoveAll`s the signal-cli dir including CDN-expired media — permanent
loss.

## Deploying a new build to a live install

**`RELEASE=1` is required.** Without it `build.sh` stamps the dev bundle id
(`com.openmessage.app.dev`) on purpose — see [bundle-id
shadowing](#bundle-id-shadowing--only-one-app-may-claim-comopenmessageapp).
Copying a dev-id build into `/Applications` would silently orphan the
`defaults write com.openmessage.app V2Primary` lever and the notification grant.

```
RELEASE=1 DEVELOPER_ID="Developer ID Application: Max Ghenis (8VB5UKQZC6)" ./macos/build.sh
osascript -e 'quit app "OpenMessage"'      # fully quit; `open -a` on a running app won't relaunch it
rm -rf /Applications/OpenMessage.app && cp -R macos/build/OpenMessage.app /Applications/
xattr -cr /Applications/OpenMessage.app
open -a OpenMessage
```

Confirm the deployed bundle kept the release id:

```
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Print :CFBundleIdentifier' /Applications/OpenMessage.app/Contents/Info.plist
# -> com.openmessage.app   (NOT ...app.dev)
```

**Building from a nested `.claude/worktrees/*` checkout needs `GOWORK=off`.**
Go walks up, finds `~/openmessage/go.work`, and resolves the main module to the
parent — `go build .` then fails with "main module … does not contain package
…/.claude/worktrees/<name>". Prefix the build with `GOWORK=off`.

## Bundle-id shadowing — only one .app may claim `com.openmessage.app`

LaunchServices resolves "OpenMessage" (Spotlight, Dock, `open -a OpenMessage`,
notification clicks) to *any* registered bundle declaring
`CFBundleIdentifier = com.openmessage.app`. Every build output, backup, and
Xcode archive used to declare it, so a stale build could be launched instead of
the installed app. This caused two outages; on 2026-07-25 a build predating the
self-heal OSID fix (PR #148) latched Google Messages in `needs_repair` for
~10.5h (06:54 → ~17:20).

Two fixes that **don't** work — verified 2026-07-25:

- `lsregister -u <path>` is **not durable**. Any LaunchServices rescan
  re-registers the bundle; a forced rescan brought all 14 straight back.
- Renaming `Foo.app` → `Foo.app.disabled` does nothing. LaunchServices
  registers on bundle *structure*, not the `.app` extension — it re-registered
  every renamed bundle at its new path.

What works:

- **Build outputs:** unless `RELEASE=1`, `build.sh` stamps
  `com.openmessage.app.dev` **and** names the bundle `OpenMessage (dev)`
  (`CFBundleName` + `CFBundleDisplayName`). Both matter: id-based launches
  (notification clicks, `open -b`) resolve by `CFBundleIdentifier`, but
  name-based launches (`open -a OpenMessage`, Spotlight) resolve by the
  registered *name*, which comes from the plist — **not** the `.app`
  filename (a bundle renamed on disk still registered as "OpenMessage" from
  its plist). With both stamped, neither launch path can land on a dev build.
- **Backups/archives kept on disk:** rename `Contents/Info.plist` →
  `Contents/Info.plist.disabled`. With no `Info.plist` LaunchServices can't read
  a bundle id. Lossless and reversible; see `~/openmessage-ROLLBACK-README.md`
  for the restore recipe.

**Sharp edge — don't run a dev GUI on the live machine.** Because the dev id
differs, macOS no longer dedupes it against the installed app: launching a dev
build alongside it starts a real second GUI. That GUI *adopts* the daemon
already listening on port 7007 (`BackendManager.reuseExistingBackendIfNeeded`
— transport-safe, it won't spawn a competing stack), but its stop path
SIGTERMs the adopted PID — **quitting the dev GUI kills the live backend out
from under the installed app.** If that happens, relaunch the installed app.
Tracked with the other dev-id-scoped traps in issue #165.

Audit (should print exactly `/Applications/OpenMessage.app`):

```
/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -dump \
 | awk '/^[[:space:]]*path:[[:space:]]/ { p=$0; sub(/^[[:space:]]*path:[[:space:]]*/,"",p); sub(/ \(0x[0-9a-f]*\)$/,"",p) }
        /^[[:space:]]*identifier:[[:space:]]/ { id=$0; sub(/^[[:space:]]*identifier:[[:space:]]*/,"",id);
        if (id=="com.openmessage.app") print p; p="" }' | sort -u
```

Note `mdfind "kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier == 'com.openmessage.app'"` is **not** a
reliable audit — Spotlight keeps stale metadata for neutralized bundles and
skips dot-directories entirely (two hidden rollback bundles were found only by
a forced `lsregister -R -f`). Filter the `lsregister` dump by `identifier:` as
above.

The user's data and pairing **persist** — they live in the data dir, not in the
`.app` bundle. A fresh restart re-establishes the Google long-poll, which can
briefly show "reconnecting" before it settles (see throttling note above).

## Verifying after support work

- `curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://127.0.0.1:7007/` → 200
- `/api/status` → `google/whatsapp/signal` connection + `google.needs_repair`
  (and `google.repairs_paced`, which should stay 0/absent)
- A real send shows `OUTGOING_DELIVERED` in
  `/api/conversations/<id>/messages`. Don't re-send a user's real message as a
  "test" (duplicate risk on `UNKNOWN`, which is ambiguous about whether it sent);
  if you must test connectivity, get explicit per-send permission.
- For the ingest cutover checklist, run the [ingest smoke](#ingest-smoke)
  before switching readers.

### Ingest smoke

Read `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7007/api/status | jq '.v2_ingest'`. A healthy
enabled stack reports `enabled: true`; under `per_account`, `appended` grows as
receive frames arrive, message-bearing frames advance `projected`, and
`quarantined` remains `0`. An idle WhatsApp or Signal account can legitimately
stay at zero until a new inbound/history frame arrives.

The manual receive-only check is:

```sh
LIVE_PLATFORMS=google GOWORK=off go test -tags livetransport \
  -run TestLiveIngestVerification -v -count=1 -timeout 10m \
  ./internal/livetransport/
```

It sends nothing. Add `whatsapp` or `signal` to the comma-separated
`LIVE_PLATFORMS` list only when that platform will receive a real frame within
the test deadline; use `LIVE_GOOGLE_CONV`, `LIVE_WHATSAPP_CONV`, or
`LIVE_SIGNAL_CONV` to override the expected self-thread remote ID.
